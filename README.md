### Author's Notes

A project for the Computer Hardware Servicing (CHS) subject as a grade 11 student. This was a paired project but I coded this alone. I made this from March 10 to 12 of 2020 and is my first project in Java.

## How to Run

You need to download JDK8 in the [Oracle](http://oracle.com/) website. As of time of writing, the latest version is JDK24, but do note that running the project using later versions might cause issues/errors. Then, run the following commands: `javac E_Library.java` then `java E_Library`.
